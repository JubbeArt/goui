Requirements
	Multiline font rendering
	Image rendering
	Overflow handling

Tried but bad
	gi - 1 billion dependencies ? already does what i wanna do ?
	h8gi/canvas - uses pixel & gg
	https://github.com/tfriedel6/canvas - multiline text rendering has to be done manually
	https://github.com/llgcode/draw2d - cant draw images, no support for multiline text?
	go-cairo - incomplete binding
	Skia - hard to integrate with glfw? doesnt even compile

Potential
	nanovgo - font rendering is broken ("- _") but otherwise really good
	maybe do a new port of nanovg
